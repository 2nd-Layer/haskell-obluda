obluda - random name generator

This little utility serves as a name generator: when fed with statistical data 
about some language it outputs list of random names looking like that language.

How to compile
As this is a Haskell program, you should have some working Haskell 
implementation installed - preferably GHC, you can get it at 
http://www.haskell.org/ghc

How to use
The generator can be fed either with a corpus file or with a dump 
file. Corpus file should contain only words of given language
divided by spaces.

Usage: obluda -c corpus_file number_of_lines
              -r dump_file number_of_lines
              -d corpus_file

where "obluda -[rc] filename n" generates n names of output, 
"obluda -d filename" outputs dump of corpus file to stdout.
Dumps of several languages come with the program for immediate testing.
